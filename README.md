# COVID-19 Statistics, Forecasts and Demographics

This project began as my final project in the UC Berkeley Data Bootcamp, that ran from January through June of 2020.  I have continued to update, expand, and refine this analysis since the course ended last summer.

I sourced data from a number of sources, including Tableau's Coronavirus (COVID-19) Datahub (https://data.world/covid-19-data-resource-hub), the New York Times COVID-19 Github repository (https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data), the LA Times COVID-19 Github repository (https://github.com/datadesk/california-coronavirus-data), the CDC COVID Data Tracker (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home), the Our World in Data Coronavirus Data Tracker (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus), the U.S. COVID Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI) (https://precisionforcovid.org/ccvi), UCLA Law's COVID Behind Bars Data Project (https://uclacovidbehindbars.org/), and the COVID Tracking Project (https://covidtracking.com/).  Three different mobility indices have been followed, including Google (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/), Apple (https://covid19.apple.com/mobility), and Descartes Labs (https://www.descarteslabs.com/mobility/) help understand changes in U.S. mobility from Coronavirus-related physical distancing.
